Hi All,

I am done with the code challenge. Please find the zip folder that contains all project files.

Steps to build the application: 

1. You can install all the necessary modules by executing npm install.
2. Kindly create a Mongo DB Collection called users_ULP and create two properties called EmailID and Password.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding executing the project.

Thanks & Regards,
Sagar.
